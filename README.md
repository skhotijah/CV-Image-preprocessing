# CV-Image-preprocessing

What is image processing?
In machine learning projects in general, you usually go through a data preprocessing or cleaning step. The goal of this step is to make your data ready for the ML model to make it easier to analyze and process computationally, as it is with images. Based on the problem you’re solving and the dataset in hand, there’s some data massaging required before you feed your images to the ML model.

Image processing could be simple tasks like image resizing. In order to feed a dataset of images to a convolutional network, they must all be the same size. Other processing tasks can take place like geometric and color transformation or converting color to grayscale and many more.
